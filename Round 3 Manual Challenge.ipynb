The adventurer-archeologist also left a note with the treasure map containing some hints on how to find the biggest treasures and how to keep them to yourself.\n",

Each tile is said to hold at least 7.5k SeaShells, but rumors are going around that there might be multiple chests in one tile. Select your preferred destination(s) by clicking on the treasure map. There might be costs involved in undertaking these expeditions and you are not the only one looking for treasure. So choose your expeditions and destinations thoughtfully."
